I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the **University of Washington**. I am a group member of the [Networking and Emerging Wireless Technologies (NEWT) Lab](https://newtlab.ece.uw.edu/), advised by [Prof. Akshay Gadre](https://www.akshaygadre.com/). The core focus of my Ph.D. research will be the development of **wireless technologies for robotics**, aimed at creating intelligent robots that operate reliably in challenging environments and enhancing wireless sensing with greater mobility and coverage.

Previously, my research journey began at the [Intelligent Perception (IP) Lab](https://ustc-ip-lab.github.io/) of the **University of Science and Technology of China**. Under the guidance of [Prof. Qibin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bPLvsSAAAAAJ) and [Prof. Yan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en-EN&user=MVOCn1AAAAAJ), we focused on developing **human-centric wireless sensing** systems. Intending to enhance the sensing resolution and robustness, our work contributes innovation across a range of applicationsï¼š

- Domain-independent human motion sensing of gesture (TMC'22), localization (UbiComp'24), and tracking (IJCAI'24).  
- Robust and long-term physiological sensing of respiration (TMC'24) and heart rate variability (arXiv'24).  
- Super-resolution and handheld SAR imaging with physical models  (Comms Eng'24) and machine learning  (ICASSP'24).
