I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the **University of Washington**. I am a group member of the [Networking and Emerging Wireless Technologies (NEWT) Lab](https://newtlab.ece.uw.edu/), advised by [Prof. Akshay Gadre](https://www.akshaygadre.com/).

Previously, my research journey began at the [Intelligent Perception (IP) Lab](https://ustc-ip-lab.github.io/) of the **University of Science and Technology of China**. Under the guidance of [Prof. Qibin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bPLvsSAAAAAJ) and [Prof. Yan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en-EN&user=MVOCn1AAAAAJ), I focused on developing high-resolution and robust human-centric sensing systems with wireless devices.
